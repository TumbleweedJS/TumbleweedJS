# Tumbleweed.js

Tumbleweed.js is a Javascript game framework, using last features from HTML5,
destined to make interactive browser-based games.
its architecture is divided into modules, so you can easily use only a part of the framework.

Each Tumbleweed class is an AMD module, so you can directly load classes you need.
With an AMD optimizer like [r.js](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html), you can generate a really optimized file, throwing away all parts you don't use.

## Getting started

### Quick start

For a quick start, you can download the last version on [our website](http://www.tumbleweed-studio.net).
It provide a single minified file ready for use, containing all Tumbleweed.js components.

All you have to do is to add it in your HTML file, and you can start coding.
You should got to see [the demos](http://www.tumbleweed-studio.net/website/demo.php), all code are explained and result is displayed.

### Start with require.js

However, all games don't nedd all the features. For example, a chess game don't use the collision module.
If you want to choose only the components that you use, you can use each one separatly with [require.js](http://requirejs.org).

For that, you need to clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Tumbleweed/tumbleweed.git myGame/scripts/TW

Now, you need to tell require.js where is the path to Tumbleweed, and you can use it:

*in your require.js config:*
	
	require.config({
	  baseUrl: 'scripts',
	  paths: {
	    TW: 'TW/modules'		// this is relative to baseUrl
	  }
	});

*game.js*

	// each TW class is a AMD module. 
	require(['TW/gameloop/Gameloop', 'TW/window/Window'] , function(Gameloop, Window) {
	  //Cette fonction sera votre point d'entr√©e.
	  
	  var gl = new Gameloop();
	  var w = new Window();
	  
	  // INSERT AWESOME GAME HERE
	});


The advantages of this method are that only needed files are loaded. By using build tool like `r.js`, you can generate
very small Tumbleweed file, making your games faster to load.

You're now ready to code! You should got to see [the demos](http://www.tumbleweed-studio.net/website/demo.php), all code are explained and result is displayed.

## Build TW.js

*Note: build TW.js is note required for use it. This section is mainly usefull for contributing to Tumbleweed.*

Tumbleweed use mainly `grunt` and `require.js` for building concatened file *TW.js*. So you need Node.js and `npm`.

    npm install -g grunt
    npm install grunt-contrib
	npm install phantomjs


Grunt is a powerful command-line build system. With the grunt.js file, it provide theses following commands:

- `grunt release` (or just `grunt`): generate minified files.
  Both `release` and `debug` produce a `build` folder, containing a `TW.js` file usable alone.
- `grunt debug`: generate non minified files.
- `grunt doc`: create the documentation. All documentation use [Yuidoc](https://github.com/yui/yuidoc) syntax.
- `grunt lint`: apply jshint on all js files. it is configured for the project.
- `grunt qunit`: launch tests. There are few, but i hope to fix this soon.
